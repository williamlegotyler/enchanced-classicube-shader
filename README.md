# enchanced classicube shader
This is a texture pack for classicube ment to recreate the look and feelings of a shader,juet like the shaders on minecraft,to me it looks pretty good,the enchanchments are:
•added more contrast
•hotter colors
•high quality skybox

Here are some screenshots took in-game with the shader on:

If you use this shader i suggest you to change this settings in classicube to get the best out of this shader:

Graphics options:
•Lightning mode:fancy
•Smooth lightning:on 

Env settings:
•Clouds height:10000

Hope you like this shader!
