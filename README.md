# enchanced classicube shader
This is a texture pack for classicube ment to recreate the look and feelings of a shader,just like the shaders on minecraft,to me it looks pretty good,the enchanchments are:

•added more contrast

•hotter colors

•high quality skybox

•waving leaves

Here are some screenshots took in-game with the ultra version of this shader on:
