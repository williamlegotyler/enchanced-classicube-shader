# enchanced classicube shader
This is a texture pack for classicube ment to recreate the look and feelings of a shader,just like the shaders on minecraft,to me it looks pretty good,the enchanchments are:

•added more contrast

•hotter colors

•high quality skybox

Here are some screenshots took in-game with the ultra version of this shader on:

If you use this shader i suggest you to change this settings in classicube to get the best out of this shader:

Graphics options:

•Lightning mode:fancy

•Smooth lightning:on 

•Shadow:SnapToBlock

Hope you like this shader!
